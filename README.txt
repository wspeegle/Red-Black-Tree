Implementation is taken directly from pseudocode outlined in chapter 13 of the book. There are little to no comments because of this and
the fact that I had to rewrite all my files due to corruption at one point.
RBnode.h and RBtree.h must included in the main file. Typing "make" makes main from main.cpp and sends any errors to err.log. 
"Make run" runs main and sends the output to out.log.
